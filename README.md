# Feature Garden Front-End Architecture

Feature Garden is an opinionated feature-based architecture for component-based front-end applications.

## Problem

One of the main problems in modern application development is controlling complexity as applications grow.
Existing approaches often optimize either for early development speed or for large-scale, but struggle to provide a clear growth path from zero to complexity.

Feature Garden is an opinionated feature-based architecture inspired by components and nature.
It is designed to scale naturally from a single feature to a complex system, just like a garden grows from a small tree. Feature Garden is conducive to SoC, low coupling, high cohesion, KISS, DRY, YAGNI, and Local Reasoning.
